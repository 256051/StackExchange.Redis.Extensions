# Home

**StackExchange.Redis.Extensions** is a library that extends [StackExchange.Redis](https://github.com/StackExchange/StackExchange.Redis) allowing you a set of functionality needed by common applications. The library is signed and completely compatible with the **.NET Standard 2.0, .NET Framework 4.6.1**, **.NET Framework 4.7.2, .NET Core 3.x.** 

The idea of this library is to make easier your live when you need to send / receive objects into Redis, in fact it wraps what the main library [StackExchange.Redis](https://github.com/StackExchange/StackExchange.Redis) offers but serializing and deserializing your objects.

Here the list of the most asked features:

* **Add and retrieve complex object from and to Redis**;
